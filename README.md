## This project was created to practice:
- ES6 Modules💧
- Webpack configurations🔧
- Organized Code📁

## Details: 
- Every element has been created with Vanilla JS only.
- Made usage of ES6 Modules to gain advantage of Project Order, Encapsulation & Reusability of code. 
- Made usage of Webpack to transpile my code, and make the usage of modules possible.
- Made usage of npm, package.json, and .gitignore file.
